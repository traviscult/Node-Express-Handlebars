### Overview

I created a burger logger utilizing MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The final application was deployed through Heroku.

### User Story
As an avid burger connoisseur I want an application application that logs all of the burgers that I wish to try so that I can track which burgers are still on my bucket list.

### Deployed Application Links
The Application was deployed via Heroku:
